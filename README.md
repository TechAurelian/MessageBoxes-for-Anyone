# MessageBoxes for Anyone

MessageBoxes for Anyone is a small and modest unfinished tool designed to help you create Windows message boxes quickly and easily. It was developed back in 2003 using Borland Delphi 7.0.

This tool offers a straightforward interface for designing personalized message boxes with minimal fuss, using all available options. It provides a selection of message box types like "Information," "Warning," and others. If you're feeling adventurous, you can tweak certain aspects, like the positioning of the message box and button configurations.

A notable aspect is the tool's simplicity. Input your message, pick a message box type, and make minor adjustments using the intuitive interface. The tool then takes over, generating your tailored message box for you to preview.

For those seeking more, there are some advanced options. You can fine-tune button behaviors and actions triggered by button clicks or the help button.

It's important to note that while MessageBoxes for Anyone is a "product" of the past and remains incomplete (not all features are functional), it can still offer a glimpse into what used to be the "world" of Windows message boxes.

## Screenshots

Below are some screenshots offering a glimpse into the user interface of MessageBoxes for Anyone. Please keep in mind that these screenshots showcase an interface that remains unfinished and unpolished, featuring a distinctive style reminiscent of the geeky, Windows shareware aesthetic from the early days.

## Building

MessageBoxes for Anyone was last compiled using [Borland Delphi 7.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delphi_(software)) back in 2003, so attempting to build it with modern tools might be an interesting journey into the past. At present, it's uncertain whether newer versions of Delphi or the free Lazarus compiler can successfully compile the project. If time permits, I should explore whether [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) can compile and run the project.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to MessageBoxes for Anyone, despite its incomplete state. As some features are not implemented, the interface is rough, and the project hasn't been recompiled using modern tools since 2003, your involvement can make a meaningful difference.

To contribute, fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request. I appreciate your willingness to help resurrect MessageBoxes for Anyone.
